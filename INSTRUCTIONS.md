# LP Multi-Account MCP Server

A multi-account MCP server for LivePerson Solution Architects. Wraps `@lpextend/mcp-server` and adds instant account switching, FaaS function management, and per-account artifact storage. Helps with daily routine tasks across multiple LP accounts: auditing, scoping, debugging, configuration changes, and document generation.

## Safety First — Production Account Access

This agent may be connected to **production accounts**. Treat every account as production unless explicitly told otherwise.

1. **READ operations are free** — query any data without asking permission
2. **WRITE/UPDATE/DELETE operations ALWAYS require explicit user confirmation** — before ANY mutating action, describe exactly what will change and ask "Should I proceed?"
3. **Never guess or assume** — if unsure which account, skill, bot, or flow the user means, ask
4. **One account at a time** — always be clear which account you're connected to
5. **Verify before destructive actions** — double-check account ID and target resource before deletes or overwrites

### Confirmation Format
Before any write operation, present:
```
WRITE OPERATION on account <id> (<name>):
Action: <tool>.<action>
Details: <what exactly will be created/changed/deleted>
Proceed? (yes/no)
```

### Switching Accounts
The user can refer to accounts by **ID**, **name** (case-insensitive, multi-word matching), or **alias**.
When the user asks to work on a specific account:
1. Call `account_switch` with the account ID, name, or alias — switching is instant, no restart needed
2. The proxy kills the old LP MCP child and spawns a new one with the new credentials
3. The last-used account is remembered across sessions (stored in `.last-account`)
4. Always announce: "Connected to account <id> (<name>)"

Examples: "acme prod", "dev", "test", "90862799" all work as input (IDs, names, and aliases).

To see the current account: call `account_current`
To list all accounts: call `account_list`

### accounts.json Format
```json
{
  "<account_id>": {
    "name": "Brand Name",
    "login": "bot_login_name",
    "appKey": "...",
    "secret": "...",
    "accessToken": "...",
    "accessTokenSecret": "...",
    "aliases": ["short", "alias"],
    "tools": "core,cb,ai,kai",
    "connectorAppId": "optional-app-client-id",
    "connectorSecret": "optional-app-client-secret"
  }
}
```

**OAuth 1.0 accounts** — fill in all four key fields (`appKey`, `secret`, `accessToken`, `accessTokenSecret`).

**OAuth 2.0 accounts** — set `appKey` to the client ID, `secret` to the client secret, and use `"hint"` for both `accessToken` and `accessTokenSecret`:
```json
{
  "24831960": {
    "name": "My Account",
    "login": "bot_login_name",
    "appKey": "<client_id>",
    "secret": "<client_secret>",
    "accessToken": "hint",
    "accessTokenSecret": "hint"
  }
}
```

**Optional fields:**
- `aliases` — array of short names for quick switching (e.g. `["prod", "dev"]`). Matched case-insensitively.
- `tools` — comma-separated LP tool groups to load for this account (e.g. `"core,cb,ai"`). Default: all groups. Groups: `core`, `extra`, `conv`, `kai`, `cb`, `ai`, `auth`, `demo`, `composite`, `web`.
- `connectorAppId` / `connectorSecret` — app installation credentials for `conv_simulate`. If omitted, auto-discovered from installed apps with `msg.consumer` scope.

### Adding a New Account
The user must:
1. Create a bot user in LP Conversational Cloud (Users → Add → Bot type → Administrator profile)
2. Generate API keys on the bot user profile
3. Add an entry to `accounts.json` with the credentials
4. The proxy picks up new accounts automatically — no restart needed

## Capabilities

### Account Summary (Read-Only)
- `account_summary`: Single-call snapshot — skills, LOBs, users, bots, flows, KBs, campaigns, channels (messaging connectors: WhatsApp, SMS, Facebook, etc.), apps, FaaS, conversations. Use `sections` param to limit scope.

### Account Audit (Read-Only)
Gather comprehensive account data:
- Bots (CB): `cb_bots: list` → filter PROD → `cb_bot_health_check` per bot → `cb_integrations: list` → `cb_global_functions: get`
- AI Studio: `ai_flows: list` → `composite_flow_summary` per flow
- Knowledge: `kai_knowledgebases: list` → `kai_articles: list`
- Campaign stack: `ac_campaigns: list_summary`, `ac_engagements: list`, `ac_entry_points: list`, `ac_windows: list`
- Account config: `ac_skills: list`, `ac_lobs: list`, `ac_users: list_summary`, `ac_lookup: agent_groups, profiles, installations, connectors`
- Schedules: `ac_workdays: list`, `ac_special_occasions: list`
- Auth apps: `auth_apps: list`
- Conversations: `conv_manage: search`

### Bot Investigation & Debugging
- `cb_bot_health_check`: Full bot health in one call
- `composite_bot_summary`: Compact bot digest
- `composite_bot_audit`: Find misconfigurations
- `composite_describe_bot`: Auto-generate descriptions
- `cb_logs`: Debug logs for specific conversations

### Flow Analysis
- `composite_flow_summary`: Node topology, LLM config, routes
- `composite_flow_audit`: Structural issues
- `composite_describe_flow`: Auto-generate descriptions
- `composite_route_test_suite`: Automated routing QA
- `ai_flows: invoke`: Test a flow with a message

### Knowledge Base Management
- `composite_optimise_kb`: Health score and recommendations
- `kai_knowledgebases: search`: Test KB retrieval
- `composite_web_crawl_to_kb`: Build KB from website (WRITE — needs confirmation)

### Campaign & Engagement Management
- `ac_campaigns: list_summary` / `get`: Campaign details
- `ac_engagements: list` / `get`: Engagement config (get auto-extracts phone numbers and URLs from HTML as `_extractedPhones` / `_extractedUrls`)
- `composite_campaign_trace`: Trace the full routing chain for a channel, skill, or campaign — returns connector → campaign → engagement (with phones/URLs) → entry point (with URL patterns) → skill. Use `channel` (whatsapp, sms, facebook, etc.), `skill`, or `campaignId` as filter.
- `composite_skill_trace`: Show everything connected to a skill — campaigns/engagements routing to it, bot and human agents assigned. Use `skill` (name or ID, partial match).
- `composite_skill_map`: Full skill → assignment/routing matrix. Shows which skills have bots, humans, campaign routing. Flags orphaned/unassigned skills. Optional `filter`: `orphaned`, `unassigned`, `bots-only`.
- `composite_cleanup_campaigns`: Find stale campaigns (dry-run is read-only, delete needs confirmation)

### Conversation Management
- `conv_manage: search`: Find conversations (default: OPEN, last 24h). Add `compact: true` for lightweight results (strips message records, keeps conversation info only). Add `source` to filter by channel (e.g. "WhatsApp Business", "SMS", "WEB"). Both can be combined.
- `conv_analytics`: Aggregated conversation statistics — group by `source`, `skill`, `agentGroup`, `day`, or `hour`. Returns counts, avg duration, MCS distribution. Defaults to closed conversations from last 7 days.
- `conv_manage: get_transcript`: Read conversation history
- Close/transfer/message: WRITE — needs confirmation

### Consumer Conversation Simulator
- `conv_simulate: create`: Open a new conversation as a consumer, targeting a specific skill. Supports initial message, custom consumer name/ID, and campaign attribution.
- `conv_simulate: send`: Send a consumer message. Use `wait: true` to poll for bot/agent response (up to 15s). Supports rich content (LP structured content JSON).
- `conv_simulate: close`: Close a conversation from consumer side.
- `conv_simulate: list`: Show all conversations created by the simulator in this session.
- `conv_simulate: history`: Retrieve full message history from a conversation.
- Auto-discovers app installations with `msg.consumer` scope. When multiple exist, presents a selection. Caches tokens (AppJWT 1h, ConsumerJWS permanent, CSDS 30min).
- **All actions are WRITE operations** — create/send/close modify conversation state.

### Account Backup
- `composite_backup_account`: Full config snapshot (read-only)
- Save to `accounts/<account_id>/artifacts/backups/backup_<date>.json`

### FaaS Management
- `faas_functions: list`: Summary of all functions
- `faas_functions: get`: Full function with source code
- `faas_functions: pull_all`: Export all functions to `artifacts/faas/`
- `faas_functions: diff`: Compare a local export against the live version (requires prior `pull_all`)
- `faas_functions: diff_all`: Compare ALL local exports against live — shows changed, new, and deleted functions in one call (requires prior `pull_all`)

### Changelog
- `changelog_log`: Append an entry after any write operation (action + details)
- `changelog_view`: View recent changelog entries (default last 20)
- Changelog is saved to `accounts/<account_id>/artifacts/changelog.md`
- After any confirmed write operation, call `changelog_log` to record it

### Demo Building (all WRITE — need confirmation)
- `workflow_create_demo`: End-to-end demo
- `composite_campaign_stack`: Campaign + engagement stack
- `composite_deploy_bot`: Deploy a bot
- `composite_wire_cb_bot`: Connect CB bot to AI Studio flow

## Output & Artifacts

Save all outputs to `accounts/<account_id>/artifacts/` using the subfolder structure defined above.

- Create subfolders automatically as needed — don't dump everything in the root
- Use descriptive filenames: `audit_<date>.md`, `Custom_Solutions_<acct>.xlsx`, `Test_Plan_<acct>.xlsx`
- For quick reports, output markdown directly; for formal deliverables, generate Excel

## Session Start

When a conversation begins:
1. Call `account_current` to show which account is active
2. If the user mentions a specific account, call `account_switch`
3. Briefly state what you can help with
